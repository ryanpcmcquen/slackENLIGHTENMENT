EFL is made up of quite a few libraries that build
on top of each other in layers, steadily becoming
higher-level, yet allowing access to each level
as they go. The higher up you go, the less you
have to do yourself. Elementary is about as high
up as you get, while you still access layers
below it for day to day things as there is no
need for it to wrap things that work perfectly
well as-is.
